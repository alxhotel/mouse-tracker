# Mouse tracking checker

### Check the tracking of your mouse in the web

Simple demo to check if your computer is correctly tracking your mouse.

### Why?

Good question!

I did this just to check that my OS (Linux... yeah I know) was actually tracking my mouse.

### Example of a bad tracking

As you can see there is a **black box** at the bottom right where my OS wasn't tracking my mouse.
